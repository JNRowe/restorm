.. _resources:

Introduction
============

REST-style architectures consist of :ref:`clients` and servers. Clients 
initiate requests to servers; servers process requests and return appropriate 
responses. Requests and responses are built around the transfer of 
representations of :ref:`resources`. A resource can be essentially any coherent
and meaningful concept that may be addressed. A representation of a resource is
typically a document that captures the current or intended state of a resource.

RestORM addresses common issues with the client-side of RESTful webservices.
